"""Creator persona selection for the PULSE post pipeline.

After migration 0015, `content_creators` has a nullable `user_id` column:
  - NULL  = global persona, visible to ALL users
  - non-NULL = persona generated specifically for that user

`select_for_topic` now requires a `user_id` and filters to:
  WHERE is_active AND (user_id = <caller> OR user_id IS NULL)

so each user sees their own AI-generated personas PLUS the neutral global
basics, but never another user's personas.
