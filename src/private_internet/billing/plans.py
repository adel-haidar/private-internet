"""Subscription tiers and per-feature gating — the single source of truth.

Three tiers, ranked free < pro < max:

    free  — Health, Jobs, Finances/Banking, Memory/Brain, PULSE text-only posts
    pro   — ARIA (music), SIGNAL (video), PULSE images + short video clips
    max   — STORIES

Anything NOT listed in ``FEATURE_MIN_PLAN`` is free. The frontend mirrors these
two maps (served via /api/billing/status) so gating stays in one place.

Gating is INERT while billing is disabled: ``effective_plan`` returns "max" when
``billing_enabled`` is False, so the current deployment is unaffected until
Stripe prices + the flag are configured.
