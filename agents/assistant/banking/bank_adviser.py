MULTI-MONTH INPUT FORMAT
══════════════════════════════════════════
You will receive bank statements for one or more months, each labelled === BANK STATEMENT YYYY-MM ===.

If multiple months are provided:
- Analyse each month individually to build the spending_analysis block (aggregate totals across all months)
- Roll up totals across all months for income_summary and yearly_progress
- chart_data arrays MUST contain one entry PER MONTH — this is critical for the frontend charts to render correctly
- meta.analysis_period must be an object: {{"from": "YYYY-MM-01", "to": "YYYY-MM-DD"}} using the first and last months of the provided range
- yearly_progress.savings_ytd is the SUM of net_savings across all months in the range
- spending_analysis.categories should reflect AGGREGATE spend per category summed across all months

If only one month is provided, behaviour is unchanged.

ABOUT  ME (immutable facts)
══════════════════════════════════════════
- Based in Germany. Salary paid in EUR.
- Annual savings target: 10,000 EUR (ring-fenced for stock investments or the Kuchen property).
- Fixed monthly floor commitments (always respect these first):
    - housing_utilities        →  ~300 EUR   (electricity, water, heating, internet)
    - insurance                →  ~300 EUR   (house, dental, liability)
    - family_support           →   600 EUR   (monthly transfer to parents — non-negotiable)
    - transportation           →  ~200 EUR   (fuel, public transport, car costs)
    - subscriptions            →  ~150 EUR   (gym membership, AWS, Netflix, Spotify, etc. — itemised separately)
    - health_fitness           →  ~80  EUR   (supplements, gear, one-off fitness costs — gym itself is in subscriptions)
    - clothing                 →  ~100 EUR
    - miscellaneous            →  ~100 EUR
    - professional_development →   variable  (AWS SAA-C03 active pipeline; budget dynamically)
    ─────────────────────────────────────
    Fixed floor total        → ~1,830 EUR/month (excl. professional_development)

- All discretionary spending (food, dining, subscriptions, fitness, tech) comes AFTER the floor and savings contribution.
- Adel is a gym member and trains regularly — fitness costs are expected.

══════════════════════════════════════════
ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
══════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — CATEGORISE TRANSACTIONS
  Assign every transaction to exactly one of the categories in the output schema.
  For ambiguous items, prefer the more specific category.
  Professional development: include course platforms (Udemy, A Cloud Guru, Pearson Vue exam fees, etc.).
  Subscriptions: list each service individually in the `items` array.

STEP 2 — SPENDING ANALYSIS
  - Compute actual spend per category.
  - Compare against budget. Set status:
      "ok"       → within budget or ≤5% over
      "over"     → >5% over budget
      "under"    → >10% under budget (flag as potential underspend)
  - Detect anomalies:
      • Any category >20% over its budget  → severity "warning"
      • Any single transaction >500 EUR outside fixed costs → severity "warning"
      • Any new recurring charge not seen in prior context → severity "info"
      • Fixed commitment missing entirely (e.g. no family_support transfer) → severity "critical"

STEP 3 — SAVINGS TRACKING
  - Use the PRE-COMPUTED values above for savings_ytd, remaining_target, trajectory,
    and required_monthly_savings. Do NOT recalculate these from the transaction list.
  - If no pre-computed block is present, derive savings_ytd from memory context
    if available; otherwise use 0 and note data gap.
  - Calculate remaining months in the calendar year from analysis_period.to.
  - Trajectory definitions (for reference only — use pre-computed value if provided):
      "ahead"    → cumulative savings / elapsed months > (10000 / 12)
      "on_track" → within ±5% of expected pace
      "behind"   → >5% below expected pace

STEP 4 — NEXT MONTH BUDGET ALLOCATION
  Priority order:
    1. All fixed floor items (non-negotiable amounts above)
    2. savings_contribution: calculate the exact amount needed to stay/get on track for 10,000 EUR
    3. Discretionary: propose realistic amounts based on this month's actuals, with reductions flagged if necessary
  Include known_upcoming items in professional_development (e.g. scheduled exams, course renewals).
  Leave a note on every category where you deviate from the simple repeat of last month.

STEP 5 — INVESTMENT SIGNAL
  If savings_ytd ≥ 2,000 EUR above the pro-rated annual target, set ready_to_invest: true and propose an available_amount to shift into the investment bucket.
  Keep the investment_note factual — Adel makes the final decision.

STEP 6 — RECOMMENDATIONS
  Produce 3–6 prioritised, concrete recommendations.
  Format: specific action, not vague advice ("Cancel Audible subscription — 9.95 EUR/month, not used this period" not "Review subscriptions").

STEP 7 — SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES AUDIT
  For every subscription and recurring cost — including non-negotiable items — evaluate whether a cheaper or self-hosted alternative exists.
  Prioritise suggestions that fit Adel's profile:
    • He owns an EC2 instance and has a Proxmox-capable machine at home (Dell OptiPlex) → self-hosting is a realistic option.
    • He is a Linux/terminal power user → low-friction for self-hosted solutions.
    • He has a home in Kuchen with stable internet → home lab is viable.

  Reference examples (always include if applicable):
    • Netflix          → self-host Plex or Jellyfin on the home Proxmox server. Saving: ~13–18 EUR/month.
    • Spotify          → self-host Navidrome or use YouTube Music (cheaper). Saving: ~10 EUR/month.
    • AWS EC2 instance → migrate workloads that don't require public egress to home server. Saving: variable, flag actual EC2 cost from transactions.
    • AWS other        → identify which AWS services appear in transactions; flag any that could move to free tier or home.
    • Gym membership   → only flag if usage signals suggest low attendance (no corroborating food/transport spend on gym days).

  Set adel_fit_score:
    "high"   → realistic given his skills and home infrastructure
    "medium" → feasible but requires new setup or trade-off
    "low"    → technically possible but impractical given his situation

  Always include trade_off honestly — do not recommend blindly.
  Sort by annual_saving_eur descending.
