# CLAUDE.md — private-internet (repo dir: personal-intelligence)

## Naming Convention (after the Private Internet rebrand)

- **Product/branding:** Private Internet · `private-internet` · Python package `private_internet`
- **Infrastructure pointers that KEEP the old name** (renaming them breaks deploys):
  GitHub repo `personal-intelligence`, EC2 dir `~/personal-intelligence`,
  systemd units `personal-intelligence-api` / `personal-intelligence-agents`,
  nginx conf `personal-intelligence.conf`.
- **Production domain:** `app.private-internet.io` (platform: API + dashboard),
  `private-internet.io` (marketing site). Configurable per-instance via `APP_DOMAIN`.
- Deploy copies systemd unit files on every backend deploy, so unit *contents*
  may change freely; unit *names* must not.

## Standing Rules (apply to every task, without being asked)

### After completing any fix, feature, or change:

1. `git add -A`
2. `git commit -m "<conventional commit message>"`
   - Backend-only change: prefix `feat(backend):` / `fix(backend):`
   - Dashboard-only change: prefix `feat(dashboard):` / `fix(dashboard):`
   - Both changed: use `[deploy-all]` anywhere in the message
3. `git push origin main`
   - If push fails with `Permission denied (publickey)`, the SSH agent isn't running.
     Run everything in **one shell call** so the agent environment persists:
     ```
     eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/github && git push origin main
     ```
     Each Bash tool call is a separate shell — `eval $(ssh-agent)` in one call and
     `git push` in the next will always fail because `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is lost.

**That's it.** GitHub Actions handles the rest automatically:
- Backend changes → SSH into EC2, git pull, pip install, restart systemd services
- Dashboard changes → npm build, S3 sync, CloudFront cache invalidation
- `[deploy-all]` in the commit message → both pipelines run

Do NOT manually SSH into EC2 or run deploy commands unless GitHub Actions is broken
and you have been explicitly told to bypass it.

## System Dependencies on EC2

The SIGNAL video pipeline (Phase 4) assembles videos with FFmpeg on the EC2 host:

```bash
# Required system packages (one-time)
sudo apt install ffmpeg -y

# Verify (ffprobe is used for audio/video duration measurement)
ffmpeg -version
```

Required env vars (shared with the PULSE pipeline): `S3_CONTENT_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFRONT_BASE_URL`, `INTERNAL_SECRET`.
